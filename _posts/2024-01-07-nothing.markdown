Another span of time has elapsed between "TGIF" and "Well, I guess it's time to get ready for work tomorrow."

I was a little bummed because it felt like I hadn't moved my life in any particular direction.  I don't feel closer to any destination.

That's not to say that *nothing* happened, but let's just say it was a weekend about nothing.

![Bread](/assets/bread.jpg)
The supermarket was out of bread so I made some bread.  I finally got to use the batard banneton I got in Copenhagen over the summer.

![Corner](/assets/corner.jpg)
I rebuilt this corner of this hunk of piano so that eventually I can make a bench out of it.  Now I need to do the other corner and it feels like this project hasn't even started yet in spite of the hours I've put in so far.

![Cupcake](/assets/cupcake.jpg)
We made some weird cupcakes.  I accidentally overfilled the pan for a few of these and they had these funny duckbill shapes on top and we decided that just made more surface area for frosting and sprinkles.

![Chrono](/assets/chrono.jpg)
I jumped into the retro console emulation scene.  It started as a hankering to play Metal Gear Acid again, and turned into learning how to use VirtualBox to spin up a VM just to run this Windows-only flash utility to shoehorn Chrono Trigger into this SNES Classic I bought on impulse a while back and never really touched afterwards.

This is actually great because I'd never really touched hardware virtualization before for lack of necessity.  I totally skipped straight to Kubernetes and Docker, and kind of felt like I was floating around without a foundation for a while until now.  Now I have a true appreciation for not having to create an entire operating system in a bottle just to run a single stubborn program.

Till now it had been just another case of a how without a why.
