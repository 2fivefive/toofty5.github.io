My Boox Tab Ultra C just arrived and I'm having a pretty good time with it already.

I took advantage of the "back to school" deal that included the keyboard cover.

Why not just use a laptop, you ask?  Now I can sit in the backyard in direct sunlight and the e-ink display only makes the text more visible.

It took some messing around to get set up the keyboard with a grave escape, but now that that's done I pretty much have my beloved 60% layout.  I'm using Termux to get me a *nix command line and from here I can SSH out to my stuff.

Obviously the Playdate dev work won't be happening on this but so far writing this blog post in the backyard sun has been delightful and I am getting tons of sunlight.
