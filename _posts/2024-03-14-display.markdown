I've finally finished this project and it's working exactly as intended.  My only regret is that the two LED displays are slightly crooked.  I had taken for granted that they would somehow align themselves on the circuitboard but I only realized that wasn't the case after I had soldered the 14 pins.

It's extremely visible and readable from across the living room.

In any case, another one in the books.  It's in Fahrenheit for now because the numbers were bigger.  A single byte would cover up to 256 if I only wanted to display three-digit integers, but I wanted four digits of precision, so I went on a quest to learn how to send two bytes at a time, which turned out to be less than trivial.  Send-a-byte/read-a-byte is pretty simple but sending an array of bytes required I reacquaint myself with C arrays and memcpy().  I had gotten too comfortable with Python's list slices and completely forgotten the syntax for pointers.
