Things are going to get weird for a bit while I mess around with the DNS.  It's one of those things I don't do often and end up forgetting how to do, so I'm going to have to relearn everything all over again.

The old React site was hosted through the Cloudfront CDN because that was the only way to get https working, which was the only way to get the OAuth working, so there was a bunch of junk in there that I really don't need anymore.  That site is still available [here](https://main.d9jvqhx9di90m.amplifyapp.com/).  Hopefully it'll keep running for the near future.

I'm still working on Jekyll to get things the way I like, so you'll see a lot of placeholders too.  I just felt like getting started on the blogging part first.
